    "this service switching between simplified and traditional Chinese,which meets my origial expectation to see Chinese literature called \"古文觀止guanzhi\" in two ways! Moreover, I also made web crawlers for many other material from that website to enrich my service,such as __295 classic books,15919 authors,20500 aritcles from books, and 1999 quotations from books.__\n",
